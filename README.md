# 2D-FFTLog

2D-FFTLog code for efficiently computing integrals containing two Bessel or spherical Bessel functions, in the context of transforming covariance matrices from Fourier space to real space.

The code is *independently* written and tested in python ([./python/twobessel.py](python/twobessel.py)) and C ([./C/](C)).

See more details in [Fang et al (2020); arXiv:xxxx](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx), and please cite it if you find the algorithm or the code useful to your research.

Please feel free to use and adapt the code for your own purpose, and let me know if you are confused or find a bug (just open an [issue](https://github.com/xfangcosmo/2DFFTLog/issues)). FFTLog-and-beyond is open source and distributed with the
